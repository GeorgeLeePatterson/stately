description: A full blown application built with Stately that can be used today.

# Pipelines 

Using Stately and two plugins, [files](../../plugins/stately/files.md) and [arrow](../../plugins/stately/arrow.md), we will build an application that allows streaming Parquet files from one object store to another, using [DataFusion's](https://datafusion.apache.org/) powerful query engine.

## Goals

The goals of this demo are to demonstrate how even complex and immediately useful applications can be built quickly and simply with Stately. 

One of the more powerful use cases of Stately are applications that users themselves can deploy easily onto their systems and at the same time have access to a configuration UI providing them with the ability to customize the application's behavior during runtime.

This guide will be available soon, if you are interested in seeing it sooner, reach out to me and I will work on getting it up as soon as I am able.
