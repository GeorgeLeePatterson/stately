# Planned 

The following demos and guides are planned for future documentation:

## Planned Demos 


- **Streaming Data Application** - Full data streaming application
- **User-created Custom Plugin** - Develop a plugin and include it in your application's codegen.
- **Using Stately's Core to Build Custom Components** - Creating specialized components using building blocks 

In the meantime, see the [Quick Start](../start/quick-start.md) for a working example.

## Planned Guides

- **Project Structure** - Best practices and recommendations for more advanced usages.
- **Deployment** - Deploying Stately applications

## Guide Format

Each guide will follow a consistent structure:

1. **Goal** - What you'll build or accomplish
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
3. **Steps** - Numbered walkthrough with code examples
4. **Result** - What you'll have at the end
5. **Next Steps** - Where to go from here
