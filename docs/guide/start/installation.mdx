# Installation Details

Stately consists of Rust crates for the backend and TypeScript packages for the frontend. Install the packages you need based on your project requirements.

## Backend (Rust)

### Core Packages

Add the core Stately crates to your `Cargo.toml`:

```shellscript
cargo add stately
```

The `stately` crate re-exports `stately-derive`, so you don't need to add it separately.

### Feature Flags

Stately supports several feature flags:

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `openapi` | Yes | OpenAPI schema generation via `utoipa` |
| `axum` | No | Axum web framework integration (includes `openapi`) |

To enable Axum API generation for example, install with the feature included:

```shellscript
cargo add stately --features axum
```

If using Stately's "axum" and "openapi" integrations (and you should, it's what glues the backend to the frontend and provides a lot of the magic), be sure to install some additional dependencies:

```shellscript
cargo add axum 
cargo add serde --features derive
cargo add tokio --features rt,rt-multi-thread,sync,macros
cargo add tower-http --features cors # for CORS support
cargo add utoipa --features axum_extras,uuid,macros
```

### Plugin Crates

For file management capabilities:

```shellscript
cargo add stately-files
```

For data connectivity and Arrow-based queries, optionally adding object-store functionality and clickhouse integration:

```shellscript
cargo add stately-arrow --features object-store,clickhouse
```

## Frontend (TypeScript)

### Packages 

Stately packages are published to npm. Install using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @statelyjs/stately @statelyjs/ui @statelyjs/schema" />

### Peer Dependencies

The packages require several peer dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install react react-dom @tanstack/react-query lucide-react sonner openapi-fetch" />


Stately uses tailwind and [base-ui](https://base-ui.com/). Ensure tailwind is installed:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D tailwindcss" />

If you plan on using the `Editor` component from `@statelyjs/ui`, install `CodeMirror`:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @uiw/react-codemirror" />

### Plugin Packages

For file management:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @statelyjs/files" />

For data connectivity:

<PackageManagerTabs  command="install @statelyjs/arrow @tanstack/react-table @tanstack/react-virtual" />

## Development Setup
