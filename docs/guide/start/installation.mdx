# Installation Details

Stately consists of Rust crates for the backend and TypeScript packages for the frontend. Install the packages you need based on your project requirements.

## Backend (Rust)

### Core Packages

Add the core Stately crates to your `Cargo.toml`:

```shellscript
cargo add stately
```

The `stately` crate re-exports `stately-derive`, so you don't need to add it separately.

### Feature Flags

Stately supports several feature flags:

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `openapi` | Yes | OpenAPI schema generation via `utoipa` |
| `axum` | No | Axum web framework integration (includes `openapi`) |

To enable Axum API generation for example, install with the feature included:

```shellscript
cargo add stately --features axum
```

If using Stately's "axum" and "openapi" integrations (and you should, it's what glues the backend to the frontend and provides a lot of the magic), be sure to install some additional dependencies:

```shellscript
cargo add axum 
cargo add serde --features derive
cargo add tokio --features rt,rt-multi-thread,sync,macros
cargo add tower-http --features cors # for CORS support
cargo add utoipa --features axum_extras,uuid,macros
```

### Plugin Crates

For file management capabilities:

```shellscript
cargo add stately-files
```

For data connectivity and Arrow-based queries, optionally adding object-store functionality and clickhouse integration:

```shellscript
cargo add stately-arrow --features object-store,clickhouse
```

## Frontend (TypeScript)

### Packages 

Stately packages are published to npm. Install using your preferred package manager:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @statelyjs/stately" />

> [!DETAILS]
> For simple use cases, stately re-exports the most commonly used components from 'ui', such as `Layout`, `BaseForm`, etc. If you want access to the base components or other items not re-exported by stately, you can install `@statelyjs/ui` directly and import them yourself.

> [!DETAILS]
> Stately also provides a low level library `@statelyjs/schema`. There are few cases where you will need to install this yourself, much of what it provides is re-exported from `@statelyjs/stately` and enhanced to include all "core" functionality. Of course, if you find yourself needing access to some of those primitives, you can install the library directly as well.

### Peer Dependencies

The packages require several peer dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install react react-dom @tanstack/react-query lucide-react sonner openapi-fetch" />

While Stately uses tailwind and [base-ui](https://base-ui.com/), for most use cases, you shouldn't need to install tailwind yourself. But, if you are using tailwind, or want to override stately's tokens, you will need to ensure tailwind is installed:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli" />

If you plan on using the `Editor` component from `@statelyjs/ui` or any plugins that require it, install `CodeMirror`:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @uiw/react-codemirror" />

### Plugin Packages

For file management:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @statelyjs/files" />

For data connectivity:

<PackageManagerTabs  command="install @statelyjs/arrow @tanstack/react-table @tanstack/react-virtual" />
