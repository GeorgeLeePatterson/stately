# Guides

Step-by-step tutorials for common tasks when building Stately applications.

## Planned Guides

The following guides are planned for future documentation:

- **Full-Stack Example** - Complete application walkthrough
- **Custom Entity Type** - Adding a new entity to your application
- **Custom Field Component** - Creating specialized form fields
- **Connecting to a Database** - Persisting state with database backends

- **Data Exploration** - Using the arrow plugin for queries
- **Deployment** - Deploying Stately applications

In the meantime, see the [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start.md) for a working example.

## Guide Format

Each guide should follow a consistent structure:

1. **Goal** - What you'll build or accomplish
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
3. **Steps** - Numbered walkthrough with code examples
4. **Result** - What you'll have at the end
5. **Next Steps** - Where to go from here
